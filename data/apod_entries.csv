In this case, the road is US Route 163 and iconic buttes on the Navajo National Reservation populate the horizon.  The band of Milky Way Galaxy stretches down from the sky and appears to be a continuation of the road on Earth. Filaments of dust darken the Milky Way, in contrast to billions of bright stars and several colorful glowing gas clouds including the Lagoon and Trifid nebulas. The featured picture is a composite of images taken with the same camera and from the same location -- Forrest Gump Point in Utah, USA.

2025-11-10,Micro Moon vs. Super Moon,"What was so super about Wednesday's supermoon?  Last week, a full moon occurred that appeared slightly larger and brighter than usual.  The reason is that the Moon's fully illuminated phase occurred within a short time from perigee - when the Moon was its closest to the Earth in its elliptical orbit.  Although the precise conditions that define a supermoon vary, last Wednesday's supermoon was surely the closest, largest, and brightest full moon this year.  One reason supermoons are popular is because they are so easy to see -- just go outside at sunset and watch an impressive full moon rise!  Pictured here, Wednesday's supermoon is compared to April's micro moon -- when a full Moon occurs near the furthest part of the Moon's orbit -- so that it appears slightly smaller and dimmer than usual.  Given many definitions, at least one supermoon occurs each year, with another one coming next month (moon-th).",image,https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2511/SuperMicroMoon_Sanli_960.jpg,https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2511/SuperMicroMoon_Sanli_3456.jpg,,v1,"

2025-11-11,Jupiter in Ultraviolet from Hubble,"Jupiter looks a bit different in ultraviolet light.  To better interpret  Jupiter's cloud motions and to help NASA's robotic Juno spacecraft understand the planetary context of the small fields that it sees, the Hubble Space Telescope was being directed to regularly image the entire Jovian giant. The colors of Jupiter being monitored go beyond the normal human visual range to include both ultraviolet and (not pictured) infrared light.  Featured from 2017, Jupiter appears different in near ultraviolet light, partly because the amount of sunlight reflected back is distinct, giving differing cloud heights and latitudes discrepant brightnesses. In the near UV, Jupiter's poles appear relatively dark, as does its Great Red Spot and a smaller (optically) white oval to the right.  The String of Pearl storms farther to the right, however, are brightest in near ultraviolet, and so here appear (false-color) pink.  Jupiter's largest moon Ganymede appears on the upper left. Juno continues on a looping 33-day orbit around Jupiter, while Earth-orbiting Hubble is aging and now relies on a single stabilizing gyroscope.",image,https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2511/JupiterUV_HubbleSchmidt_960.jpg,https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2511/JupiterUV_HubbleSchmidt_1280.jpg,,v1,,2025-12-08 23:27:19
2025-11-12,A Super Lunar Corona,"What are those colorful rings around the Moon?  A corona.  Rings like this will sometimes appear when the Moon is seen through thin clouds.  The effect is created by the diffraction of light around individual, similarly-sized water droplets in an intervening but mostly transparent cloud.  Since light of different colors has different wavelengths, each color diffracts differently.  Lunar coronae are one of the few color  diffraction effects that can be easily seen with the unaided eye.  The featured image of a lunar corona was captured around last week's full Super Moon from near Knight's Ferry, California, USA.  To the right of the full Moon is the giant orange star Botein.  Similar coronae that form around the Sun are typically harder to see because of the Sun's great brightness.",image,https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2511/SuperLunarCorona_Houck_960.jpg,https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2511/SuperLunarCorona_Houck_4098.jpg,,v1,"

Designated M42 in the Messier Catalog, the Orion Nebula's glowing gas and dust surrounds hot, young stars. About 40 light-years across, M42 is at the edge of an immense interstellar molecular cloud only 1,500 light-years away that lies within the same spiral arm of our Milky Way galaxy as the Sun. Including dusty bluish reflection nebula NGC 1977, also known as the Running Man nebula at left in the frame, the natal nebulae represent only a small fraction of our galactic neighborhood's wealth of star-forming material.

Meteors from the annual Northern Taurid meteor shower are expected this time of year. But the digital camera exposure also records the shimmering glow of aurora, a phenomenon more often seen from our fair planet's higher geographical latitudes. Also known as aurora borealis, these northern lights are part of recent, wide spread auroral activity caused by strong geomagnetic storms.

In this frame, M32 is just left of the Andromeda Galaxy's bright core with M110 below and to the right. M32 and M110 are both elliptical galaxies themselves and satellites of the larger spiral Andromeda. By combining 60 hours of broadband and narrowband image data, the deep telescopic view also reveals tantalizing details of dust lanes, young star clusters, and star-forming regions along Andromeda's spiral arms, and faint, foreground clouds of glowing hydrogen gas. For now, Andromeda and friends are some 2.5 million light-years from our own large spiral Milky Way.

2025-11-16,Crossing Saturn's Ring Plane,"If this is Saturn, where are the rings?  When Saturn's ""appendages"" disappeared in 1612, Galileo did not understand why.   Later that century, it became understood that Saturn's unusual protrusions were rings and that when the Earth crosses the ring plane, the edge-on rings will appear to disappear.  This is because Saturn's rings are confined to a plane many times thinner, in proportion, than a razor blade.  In modern times, the robotic Cassini spacecraft that orbited Saturn frequently crossed Saturn's ring plane during its mission to Saturn, from 2004 to 2017.  A series of plane crossing images from 2005 February was dug out of the vast online Cassini raw image archive by interested Spanish amateur Fernando Garcia Navarro.  Pictured here, digitally cropped and set in representative colors, is the striking result.  Saturn's thin ring plane appears in blue, bands and clouds in Saturn's upper atmosphere appear in gold. Details of Saturn's rings can be seen in high dark shadows.

This continuous outflow of charged particles from the Sun has been quite variable of late, as the Sun emits bursts of energy, CMEs, that push out and deflect charged particles emitted by the comet itself. The result is a blue hued ion tail for Comet C/2025 A6 (Lemmon) that is not only impressively intricate but takes some unusual turns. This long-duration composite image taken from Alfacar, Spain last month captured this inner Solar System ionic tumult. Comet Lemmon is now fading as it heads out away from the Earth and Sun and back into the outer Solar System.",image,https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2511/LemmonTail_Fernandez_960.jpg,https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2511/LemmonTail_Fernandez_3728.jpg,,v1,,2025-12-13 05:08:28
2025-11-18,The Galactic Plane: Radio Versus Visible,"What does the Milky Way look like in radio waves? To better find out, GLEAM surveyed the central band of our galaxy in high resolution radio light as imaged by the Murchison Widefield Array in Australia.  As the featured video slowly scrolls, radio light (71 - 231 MHz) is seen on the left and visible light -- from the same field -- on the right. Differences are so great because most objects glow differently in radio and visible light, and because visible light is stopped by nearby interstellar dust. These differences are particularly apparent in the direction toward the center of our galaxy, seen about a third of the way through.  Among the many features that appear in the radio, bright red patches are usually supernova remnants of exploded stars, while areas colored blue are stellar nurseries filled with bright young stars.

2025-11-19,Chamaeleon Dark Nebulas,"Sometimes the dark dust of interstellar space has an angular elegance.  Such is the case toward the far-south constellation of Chamaeleon. Normally too faint to see, dark dust is best known for blocking visible light from stars and galaxies behind it. In this 11.4-hour exposure, however, the dust is seen mostly in light of its own, with its strong red and near-infrared colors creating a brown hue. Contrastingly blue, a bright star Beta Chamaeleontis is visible on the upper right of the V, with the dust that surrounds it preferentially reflecting blue light from its primarily blue-white color.  All of the pictured stars and dust occur in our own Milky Way Galaxy with one notable exception: a white spot just below Beta Chamaeleontis is the galaxy IC 3104, which lies far in the distance.  Interstellar dust is mostly created in the cool atmospheres of giant stars and dispersed into space by stellar light, stellar winds, and stellar explosions such as supernovas.",image,https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2511/Chamaeleon_Houbo_960.jpg,https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2511/Chamaeleon_Houbo_3691.jpg,,v1,"

Its greenish coma and faint tails are seen against a background of stars in the constellation Virgo in this view from planet Earth, recorded with a small telescope on November 14. But this interstellar interloper is the subject of an on-going, unprecedented Solar System-wide observing campaign involving spacecraft and space telescopes from Earth orbit to the surface of Mars and beyond. And while the comet from another star-system has recently grown brighter, you'll still need a telescope if you want to see 3I/ATLAS from planet Earth.

The remarkable image was recorded on November 20, when Saturn's rings were nearly edge-on when viewed from planet Earth. In fact, every 13 to 16 years the view from planet Earth aligns with Saturn's ring plane to produce a series of ring plane crossings. During a ring plane crossing, the interplanetary edge-on perspective makes the thin but otherwise bright rings seem to disappear. Saturn itself was close to the Sun on the sky and difficult to see this year, during the last ring plane crossing on March 23. But by November 23rd Saturn's rings will have reached a minimum angle for now, at their narrowest for viewing from planet Earth, and then start to widen again. Of course, Dione and Rhea orbit Saturn near the ring plane once every 2.7 and 4.5 days respectively, while the next series of Saturn ring plane crossings as seen from Earth will begin again in 2038.",image,https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2511/SATURN2025-11-20-1130.jpg,https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2511/SATURN2025-11-20-1130.tif,,v1,Christopher Go,2025-12-13 05:08:28

The star is shedding its outer envelope in a strong stellar wind, ejecting the equivalent of the Sun's mass every 10,000 years.  In fact, the Crescent Nebula's complex structures are likely the result of this strong wind interacting with material ejected in an earlier phase.

Complex dust lanes visible within also indicate that NGC 1316 is itself the result of a merger of galaxies in the distant past. Found on the outskirts of the Fornax galaxy cluster, NGC 1316 is known as Fornax A. One of the visually brightest of the Fornax cluster galaxies it is one of the strongest and largest celestial radio sources with radio emission extending well beyond this one degree wide field-of-view.",image,https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2512/FornaxA_final_apod1024.jpg,https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2512/FornaxA_final_apod.jpg,,v1,Simone Curzi,2025-12-13 05:08:28
2025-12-05,The Bipolar Jets of KX Andromedae,"Blasting outward from variable star KX Andromedae, these stunning bipolar jets are 19 light-years long. Recently discovered, they are revealed in unprecedented detail in this deep telescopic image centered on KX And and composed from over 692 hours of combined image data. In fact, KX And is spectroscopically found to be an interacting binary star system consisting of a bright, hot B-type star with a swollen cool giant star as its co-orbiting, close companion. The stellar material from the cool giant star is likely being transferred to the hot B-type star through an accretion disk, with spectacular symmetric jets driven outward perpendicular to the disk itself. The known distance to KX And of 2,500 light-years, angular size of the jets, and estimated inclination of the accretion disk lead to the size estimate for each jet of an astonishing 19 light-years.

2025-12-06,Apollo 17 at Shorty Crater,"Fifty three years ago, in December of 1972, Apollo 17 astronauts Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt spent about 75 hours on the Moon exploring the Taurus-Littrow valley, while colleague Ronald Evans orbited overhead. This snapshot from another world was taken by Cernan as he and Schmitt roamed the lunar valley's floor. The image shows Schmitt next to the lunar rover parked along the south rim of Shorty Crater.  That location is near the spot where geologist Schmitt discovered orange lunar soil. The Apollo 17 crew returned with 110 kilograms of rock and soil samples, more than was returned from any of the other lunar landing sites. And for now, Cernan and Schmitt are the last to walk on the Moon.",image,https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2512/moonshorty_apollo17_1080.jpg,https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2512/moonshorty_apollo17_1498.jpg,,v1,,2025-12-13 05:08:28
2025-12-07,The Sun and Its Missing Colors,"It is still not known why the Sun's light is missing some colors.  Here are all the visible colors of the Sun, produced by passing the Sun's light through a prism-like device.  The spectrum was created at the McMath-Pierce Solar Observatory and shows, first off, that although our white-appearing Sun emits light of nearly every color, it appears brightest in yellow-green light.  The dark patches in the featured spectrum arise from gas at or above the Sun's surface absorbing sunlight emitted below.  Since different types of gas absorb different colors of light, it is possible to determine what gasses compose the Sun.  Helium, for example, was first discovered in 1868 on a solar spectrum and only later found here on Earth.  Today, the majority of spectral absorption lines have been identified - but not all.

2025-12-08,Flying Over the Earth at Night,"Many wonders are visible when flying over the Earth at night.  Such visual spectacles occur every day for astronauts in low Earth orbit, but the featured video captured several from the International Space Station (ISS) in 2011 and set them to rousing music.  Passing below are white clouds, orange city lights, lightning flashes in thunderstorms, and dark blue seas.  On the horizon is the golden haze of Earth's thin atmosphere, frequently decorated by dancing auroras as the video progresses.  The green parts of auroras typically remain below the space station, but the station flies right through the red and purple auroral peaks.  Solar panels of the ISS are seen around the frame edges.  The ominous wave of approaching brightness at the end of each sequence is just the dawn of the sunlit half of Earth, a dawn that occurs every 90 minutes.

2025-12-09,The Heart of the Soul Nebula,"This cosmic close-up looks deep inside the Soul Nebula. The dark and brooding dust clouds outlined by bright ridges of glowing gas are cataloged as IC 1871. About 25 light-years across, the telescopic field of view spans only a small part of the much larger Heart and Soul nebulae. At an estimated distance of 6,500 light-years, the star-forming complex lies within the Perseus spiral arm of the Milky Way, seen in planet Earth's skies toward the constellation of the Queen of Aethiopia (Cassiopeia). An example of triggered star formation, the dense star-forming clouds of IC 1871 are themselves sculpted by the intense winds and radiation of the region's massive young stars. This color image adopts a palette made popular in Hubble images of star-forming regions.",image,https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2512/Soul_Bugin_1080.jpg,https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2512/Soul_Bugin_3710.jpg,,v1,"

2025-12-10,The Horsehead Nebula,"Sculpted by stellar winds and radiation, this dusty interstellar molecular cloud has by chance assumed an immediately recognizable shape. Fittingly known as The Horsehead Nebula, it lies some 1,500 light-years distant, embedded in the vast Orion cloud complex. About five light-years ""tall,"" the dark cloud is cataloged as Barnard 33, first identified on a photographic plate taken in the early 20th century.  B33 is visible primarily because its obscuring dust is silhouetted against the glow of emission nebula IC 434.  Hubble Space Telescope images from the early 21st century find young stars forming within B33. Of course, the magnificent interstellar cloud will slowly shift its apparent shape over the next few million years. But for now the Horsehead Nebula is a rewarding though difficult object to view with small telescopes from planet Earth.",image,https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2512/IC434NM900.jpg,https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2512/IC434NM.jpg,,v1,George Chatzifrantzis,2025-12-13 05:08:28
2025-12-11,Galaxies in the River,"Large galaxies grow by eating small ones. Even our own galaxy engages in a sort of galactic cannibalism, absorbing small galaxies that are too close and are captured by the Milky Way's gravity. In fact, the practice is common in the universe and illustrated by this striking pair of interacting galaxies from the banks of the southern constellation Eridanus, The River. Located over 50 million light years away, the large, distorted spiral NGC 1532 is seen locked in a gravitational struggle with dwarf galaxy NGC 1531, a struggle the smaller galaxy will eventually lose. Seen nearly edge-on in this sharp image, spiral NGC 1532 spans about 100,000 light-years. The NGC 1532/1531 pair is thought to be similar to the well-studied system of face-on spiral and small companion known as M51.",image,https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2512/NGC1532_1024.jpg,https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2512/NGC1532.jpg,,v1,Vikas Chander,2025-12-13 05:08:28
2025-12-12,Northern Fox Fires,"In a Finnish myth, when an arctic fox runs so fast that its bushy tail brushes the mountains, flaming sparks are cast into the heavens creating the northern lights. In fact the Finnish word ""revontulet"", a name for the aurora borealis or northern lights, can be translated as fire fox. So that evocative myth took on a special significance for the photographer of this northern night skyscape from Finnish Lapland near Kilpisjarvi Lake. The snowy scene is illuminated by moonlight. Saana, an iconic fell or mountain of Lapland, rises at the right in the background. But as the beautiful nothern lights danced overhead, the wild fire fox in the foreground enthusiastically ran around the photographer and his equipment, making it difficult to capture in this lucky single shot.

2025-12-13,Orion and the Ocean of Storms,"On December 5, 2022, a camera on board the uncrewed Orion spacecraft captured this view as Orion approached its return powered flyby of the Moon.  Beyond one of Orion's extended solar arrays lies dark, smooth, terrain along the western edge of the Oceanus Procellarum. Prominent on the lunar nearside Oceanus Procellarum, the Ocean of Storms, is the largest of the Moon's lava-flooded maria. The lunar terminator, the shadow line between lunar night and day, runs along the left of this frame. The 41 kilometer diameter crater Marius is top center, with ray crater Kepler peeking in at the edge, just right of the solar array wing. Kepler's bright rays extend to the north and west, reaching the dark-floored Marius. By December 11, 2022 the Orion spacecraft had returned to its home world. The historic Artemis 1 mission ended with Orion's successful splashdown in planet Earth's water-flooded Pacific Ocean.
